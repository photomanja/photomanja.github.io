- title: The Company
  body: |
    TI Solutions AG develops high-quality and flexible stimulation devices and treatment-planning tools 
    for temporal interference (TI) research. The company was founded in December 2019 in Zurich, Switzerland, 
    by the creators of the TI concept in collaboration with <a href="https://www.z43.swiss/" target="_blank" >Z43</a> 
    to specifically foster TI research.

- title: TI Devices
  body: |
   The neurostimulation devices under development will support both alternating current and TI stimulation, 
   multiple stimulation channels, a wide carrier-frequency range, flexible modulation, magnetic resonance imaging 
   and electroencephalogram recording compatibility, and more. 

- title: TI Solutions Early Adopter Program (EAP)
  closed: true
  teaser: TI Solutions aims to facilitate research into TI-based applications. We are pulling together a selected group of researchers as part of our Early Adopter Program who are interested in applying our investigational TI stimulation device as part of their research and/or clinical studies.

  body: |
   <h4>What is the TI Solutions EAP?</h4>
   The EAP will play a pivotal role in validating our new technology and its components. The Early Adopter Group will be able to use the device in their research projects, allowing them to advance the existing knowledge base through *in vitro* and *in vivo* studies and to investigate the potential benefits of TI stimulation. In turn, we will be able to gain insights into the researchers’ needs which will help drive the development of the specifications for a future medical device.
   <h4>How can I become part of the EAP?</h4>
   Interested researchers can [contact us](mailto:eap@temporalinterference.com) to arrange a conference call for initial discussion before submitting a written proposal that will be evaluated by the Board of TI Solutions for scientific significance, topicality, originality and feasibility of the project. Projects that are approved by the Board enter the EAP.
   
   **Note that a prerequisite for receiving the TI stimulation device for the proposed research project as part of the program is that the study has gained ethical approval by the responsible institutional committee.**
   
   The first TI devices will become available at the end of February 2022. Groups that are part of the EAP can rent a device for CHF 500 / month including maintenance and support (the 8-channel device on special request). The MRI-compatible version would be available at an additional cost of CHF 100 per month. The minimal rental period is six months.
   <h4>Additional Services</h4>
   The IT’IS Foundation offers specialized services for the development of experiment-specific graphical user interfaces to support TI planning and simulations and provides guidance on research protocols and experimental design as needed.

- title: Treatment-Planning Tools
  body: |
   The treatment-planning tools will provide high-quality visualization and optimization of alternating current and 
   TI stimulation configurations based on electromagnetic simulations involving detailed, high-resolution representations 
   of head anatomies of both humans and animals. Thanks to a state-of-the-art cloud-based modeling platform, simulations 
   of complex and realistic setups can be performed without specialized software or hardware. A particular focus is placed 
   on flexibility with regard to optimization criteria (for scientific exploration), good user guidance, and powerful visualization. 
   In 2021, personalized treatment modeling will be added that allows the modeling of any anatomy as well as any electrode shape and placement.
   
- title: Services
  body: |
   Our team will provide all engineering services required for the optimal application of the developed TI devices and 
   treatment-planning tools, such as troubleshooting support, replacement of defective devices, and repairs. 
   We are happy to contribute to drafting research proposals and to perform simulations for the treatment planning if required. 
   We are also interested in discussing and, if feasible, incorporating additional features into our devices and software tools.
    
- title: The Science
  body: |
   Temporal Interference (TI) stimulation is a noninvasive technique that uses scalp electrodes to apply interfering electrical
   high-frequency currents to reach structures deep inside the brain. While the applied frequencies of the electric fields themselves 
   are too high to induce neural firing, the frequency of the envelop can drive neural activity. This new concept holds great promise 
   for both research and clinics as it may open up new experimental opportunities and may be used for selective deep brain stimulation 
   to treat certain disorders without the necessity of surgically implanting electrodes within certain brain areas, which is still common practice today.
